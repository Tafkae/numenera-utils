## What it is

A companion web app for [Numenera](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product-line/numenera/) (a science-fantasy TTRPG by Monte Cook Games). It's designed to streamline the character creation process by displaying all available character options from a variety of sourcebooks, and automatically filling in values where possible.

Please note that, in accordance with [MCG's Fan Use Policy](https://www.montecookgames.com/fan-use-policy/), descriptive text for individual options is not provided. However, I've included page references for each item so you can quickly find them in the official sourcebooks. Sorry for the inconvenience. üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**Features**
- Digital character creator

**Possible future features**
- Crafting calculator
- Random cypher generator

## Installation and Getting Started

1. [Download & install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) v22.14.0 or higher.

2. Clone this repository (or download and extract from ZIP).

3. Install dependencies from the command line in your local root folder: `$ npm install`

4. By default, the app runs on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000). However, this setting can cause issues if you're testing other apps on port 3000 that also use LocalStorage. To use a different port, create a file named `.env` in the app's root directory and add the following line:

   ```ini
   PORT=1336  # or use yor own number
   ```
5. Start the app from the command line with `$ npm run start`.

## Unit tests

The app uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for unit testing.
**NOTE:** Test suite is currently inoperative.

~~Once you've cloned the repository, you can run the test suite from CLI:~~
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run test
```
~~It's set up to generate a coverage report as well, which you can view at `/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`. üìä~~
